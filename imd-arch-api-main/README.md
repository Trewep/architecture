# Randal's Video Store - Example API

In this project we want to provide an API for accessing the inventory of an early 90's video store. The frontend will be designed by another party; we are only to provide the API itself.

## Usage scenarios/use cases

- Get a list of all the movies filtered by name. All properties should be returned.
- Get a single movie. All properties should be returned.
- Delete a single movie by Id.
- Create a new movie. All properties are mandatory.

## Usage

1. clone/download the code
2. open the subfolder `RandalsVideoStore.Api` in VS Code. It should ask to add resources; press `yes`.
3. open a terminal
4. `dotnet watch run`
5. <https://localhost:5000/swagger/index.html>.
6. Behold!
